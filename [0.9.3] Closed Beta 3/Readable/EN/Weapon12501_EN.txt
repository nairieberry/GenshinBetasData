 
Possessed of sky-shaking bravery.
Even the vile dragon born from sin in the ancient kingdom of the abyss,
Lost its wings to this proud servant of Anemo.
 
The shadow dragon Durin terrorized Mondstadt.
Awoken by the cries of its victims,
The Anemo Archon summoned his faithful servant.
He rode against the shadow dragon to protect life and freedom.
 
Dvalin unleashed its six-winged fury,
Slashing through Durin's iron scales.
Striking out with its wind-blade claws in draconic combat,
Dvalin pierced deep into Durin's black, rotten flesh.
 
The battle tore the world asunder, veiling the sun.
Dvalin tore out Durin's throat, and evil was overcome.
A victory won, a people saved, by the blessed Anemo dragon Dvalin.
Yet Dvalin became poisoned by tainted blood, and it sank deep into his bones.
 
Now a fallen hero, poor Dvalin's rotting flesh drew monsters.
Lost he became, deceived by the abyss. He fell to evil, and Stormterror was born.
At last his master returned to calm his frenzied mind and ease his pain.
Cleanse the land did they, and restore Dvalin's honor.
 
While the dragon slumbered, Mondstadt forgot its savior's powers.
But it returned once again, to demonstrate its full might.
Blessed by the Anemo Archon, surrounded by Barbatos' songs,
Riding on the boundless winds, Dvalin took flight once more.
