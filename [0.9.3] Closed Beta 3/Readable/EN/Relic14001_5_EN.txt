 
An ancient hourglass with fine powdered snow flowing in it.
Even the coldest winter cannot freeze the flow of time.
 
"The cold of the glaciers can freeze time itself."
This myth was widely believed throughout the tribe.
But the Icebreaker scoffed at the idea. For he was the hero to challenge the giant snake.
 
As the Icebreaker reached the top of the Wall of Lament, night was descending and the winds were howling.
As he set foot upon the glaciers of the north, the sun began gleaming through the storms.
Even the bleakest storm cannot freeze the river of time,
and even the most formidable hero will one day be forgotten.
