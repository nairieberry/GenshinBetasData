 
The feather of a bird that had never experienced the brisk winter is now frozen in ice.
The memory of the knight this feather carries will eventually fade, just as the ice will thaw.
 
The knight wandered along with the North Wind.
As feared as he was respected, he became known as the Knight of Boreas.
 
When the Knight of Boreas noticed the whispered complaints of the people, he would set off on another journey.
Perhaps the day would come when the winter ended. Sometimes, the Knight of Boreas mused aloud to the North Wind:
"A day may come whenâ€”"
But the moment he spoke, his words would be frozen by the howling wind.
 
"...when I can be in the land of spring, where flowers cover the earth and birds migrate homeward."
Walking with the North Wind, the Knight of Boreas had always been waiting for the spring buried deep in his memory.
Smiling wryly as he inspected the frozen feather, he wondered if the bird it came from shared his fate: lost in transit, with nowhere to call home.
