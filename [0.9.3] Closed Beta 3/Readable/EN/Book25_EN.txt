One day, the Boar Princess heard about the pup and was deeply saddened by his story.
So she asked her people about how to defrost his heart and turn him back to his former sweet self.
She asked and asked, but only the wise fox and the elderly turtle knew the answer:
"Ack-ack-ack! Only sincerity and fire could melt such evil ice. Ack-ack-ack!" The fox replied.
"Friendship demands sacrifice. No friendships come without sacrifices. I apologize for not knowing how to make funny sounds," the trustworthy Grandpa Turtle said.
The clever Boar Princess knew right away what she had to do. She dried her tears and curtsied to the two wise animals:
"Oink oink! Thank you! I would like you to go see the pup with me, so you could be the first to witness our friendship!"
When the fox and the turtle heard the Boar Princess was willing to invite them on a royal trip, their hearts were full of joy. They set out with the Princess and headed north.
 
(A piece of paper that appears to be written on by the little girl's father is taped to the page: "Turtles can't make noises, and we can't force them to do so. This needs special explanation since Grandpa Turtle is very polite.")
