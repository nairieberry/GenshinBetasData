 
An icy feather from the Winterbird.
You can almost hear the howling of storms just by touching it.
 
With no nest or shelter, the bird faced the storms proudly.
Stormy winds assailed the bird's feathers with ice and snow, leaving them coated in pearls of frost.
 
One feather was plucked violently from the bird by the formidable winds.
It drifted a while in the air before the weight of the frost dragged it back down to the ground.
