 
A great hero who had conquered the stormy lands, the Icebreaker was no doubt worthy of this crown of honor.
For it was he who once scaled the Wall of Lament to do battle with the infamous Giant Glacial Snake.
 
The Icebreaker claimed that he had no fear of the bleak winter, and could shatter any ice that stood in his way.
He donned his winter crown and marched north with determination.
 
Ultimately, the Icebreaker was overcome by the freezing winter. It devoured him and froze his blood.
All that remains is this crown and the story of its bearer.
