 
An hourglass of ice.
Eternal winds, not sands, flow inside.
 
The Knight of Boreas walked with the North Wind, his armor covered in frost.
On his endless journey, the cold winters were gifts scattered around the land.
 
Solidified frost obstructed his movements in combat amidst storms.
When the Knight of Boreas rested, hopes of brief respite were dashed as he saw the ice on his armor only grew thicker while stationary.
The knight had long forgotten his days as a wanderer.
The eternal icy winds had long since frozen time.
