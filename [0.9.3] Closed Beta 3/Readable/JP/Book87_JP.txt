
To my dear companions, the Treasure Thieves:
I have devised a master plan both lucrative and feasible,
To miss this lifetime opportunity is inconceivable,
So if you find this notion to be thoroughly agreeable,
This night should we deliberate on matters diabolical.
If I alone am masked, I shall be unidentifiable;
We all must mask our faces, and by this be recognizable.
(That masks improve on nature's gifts is also undeniable.)
Please rest assured that loyalty is to me intransgressible,
So put your trust in me and know betrayal is impossible.
Now, don disguises and await with eagerness unstoppable:
The perfect crime, in aspects economical and optical.
See you there!
