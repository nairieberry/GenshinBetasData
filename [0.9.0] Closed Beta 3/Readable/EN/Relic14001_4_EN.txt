 
This is a flower that blooms in the storms. It has long been extinct.
It does not bring warmth to its bearer. Rather, it gives them the strength to embrace the winter.
 
Long ago, the Icebreaker plucked this flower from the ice cliff where it bloomed in the stormy winter.
Perhaps the defiant hero was touched, even just for a moment, by the resilience of the flower.
 
The Icebreaker broke his way forth through the glaciers,
and challenged the giant snake that lurked in the frozen abyss.
 
The heroism of the Icebreaker was forgotten, buried in the storms of the North.
Since then, the snow has melted â€” but this flower has not withered.
