 
The longsword he brandished on high was like unto a flash in the night.
To the end, not even once was the sword's edge marred by blood.
It is said that generations thereafter would use that sword as the basis for the noble knight's saber.
 
A darkened blade blended into the nights of yore with ease,
For in those days, people feared to light fires in the nighttime.
In the songs of some bards, it was stained black in the times of the aristocracy.
 
Reading the tales and songs of his upright ancestors sowed seeds of rebellion in the young noble's heart.
When the time came, he forsook his venerable house, and took the sword into hiding in the streets.
There he roamed the dark alleys and taverns like the common folk, and put his noble swordsmanship to use by robbing the rich to give to the poor.
The sword from an opulent arsenal leaped across night-lit roofs and streets in the hands of one with equally noble blood,
And its flashing edge never dulled, like the heart of the gentleman thief who had forsaken his corrupt lineage.
 
But wine and song and youth would fade, and many things would happen.
In the end, when under moonlight he buried his beloved blade and fled across the sea,
He remembered that night when he had stolen it from his family's vault,
And he remembered his vow to his family, to past and present, to his land, and to his sworn brother Ebelhart:
"Even if only by a little, I want to use my strength to turn this dark world around."
