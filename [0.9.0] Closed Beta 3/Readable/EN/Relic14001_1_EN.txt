 
A cup made of ice. Though it is cold, it does not bite the skin.
For the heroic Icebreaker, who once fought a giant snake in the bleak winter,
even his wine glass had to be made out of ice.
 
Drinking fine wine from this glass feels like swallowing icicles that sting every inch of one's throat.
Ordinary people would struggle to enjoy this sensation â€” but the Icebreaker relished it.
 
The Icebreaker had already learned to enjoy the sensation of each breath in the ice-cold air, which felt like a sword cutting at his lungs.
Likewise, he took pleasure in the glass of ice-cold wine that stung the throat.
