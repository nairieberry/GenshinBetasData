 
The Iris Rift is a legendary weapon left behind by the ascended craftsman, Kunwu.
It is listed in Kunwu's Arsenal under "Polearms."
 
Into the sea a meteorite fell. Steam erupted from within and tore the heavens open. The phenomenon persisted, as if the realm of the adepti was finally revealed for good.
Into the ethereal mist the onlookers ventured, and disappeared like birds into cloud. None knew what tragedies may have beset them during their long absence.
 
Kunwu, the master craftsman, drawn to the gold and jade inside the rock, pondered for three days before sailing his boat straight into the mist. None stood in his way.
Kunwu returned on the ninth day, his hair white â€” decades seemed to have passed. He returned with a wealth of knowledge on the meteorite's contents. Men believed him to be enlightened, knowing of the divine islet amidst the ethereal mist. However, none dared to set foot in the mist, and the Millelith also forbade anyone from venturing there.
 
Kunwu went into seclusion for a decade, accepting no apprentices, teaching no lessons, receiving no visitors, and taking no work. Yet, his anvil sounded daily from dawn to dusk. He crafted a single polearm from the meteoric iron. The creation shook the mountains and seas, its light piercing the sky, dispersing the mist on the sea.
 
As the mist dispersed, the people of Liyue saw the falsehood of their belief in the divine islet.
And Kunwu named the polearm "Iris Rift."
